Collaboration Note
To collaborate with a teammate on improving this task, we could:
Set up a shared Git repository for version control.
Use pull requests for code reviews before merging changes.
Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
Schedule regular pair programming sessions to tackle complex features together.

If I had more time, I would:
Implement a persistent database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL Moongose, SQLite).
Add authentication and authorization for API endpoints.
Implement more comprehensive error handling and logging.
Add additional endpoints for updating and deleting superheroes.
Implement pagination for the GET /superheroes endpoint.
